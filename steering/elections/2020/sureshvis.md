# Bio

Suresh Visvanathan, Sr Director of Engineering, Cloud Platform at Yahoo (Verizon Media). Suresh leads the Kubernetes/Istio effort and team at Yahoo which has one of the largest on-prem Kubernetes and Istio deployments. Suresh’s responsibilities also include the architecture, vision, strategy and design of cloud platform-as-a-service (PaaS). Suresh has also been architecting solutions and building a Platform which serves a few millions QPS using Istio, Kubernetes, Docker, Apache traffic Server. He is a frequent speaker at Kubecon meet-ups and other Bay area meetups. 


Suresh’s journey with Istio started very early on, back to its inception in 2017. Having seen the potential Istio had to solve many use-cases within Yahoo he was the first to introduce it internally. He joined Google’s Early Engagement program for Istio to help share his product vision and steer the future roadmap. A few of the notable contributions that he was able to make as a part of the program were to provide guidance around the security aspects of the Istio auth architecture, emphasize the need for flexibility in extending the Pilot generated configuration, and provide real world performance testing scenarios. This feedback was translated into production ready features that are part of Istio core today.
